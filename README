Okay, this is just a default Vundle.

For this to work, you have to add this in your ~/.vimrc:

source ~/<vimfiles_dir>/vimrc

Then, you have to install vundle in your <vimfiles_dir>. Also easy:

git clone http://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/<vimfiles_dir>/vundle

Then, in Normal mode, type ':BundleInstall!'

Yeah, that's it. Hard, huh?
